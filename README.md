# Online-Judge-Codes
Here lie my attempted solutions to various *online judge problems*

### Confession
I don’t that much participate in *online programming contests*. Also I don't at all like solving practice problems because of various reasons. So, majority of the **solutions** that you are going to find exist here mostly because I was probably *forced to solve them*. 
And it’s not that I am not much in **problem solving** or **contest programming** only because I’m *lazy*. I’m both **lazy** and **good-for-nothing** as a person.

### Legalizing Terrorization
If you are **unlucky** enough to have needed to go through any of the provided solutions and more likely didn't get to understand any of it, *feel free* to knock me [here](https://www.facebook.com/leon.wasiul). *Thereby, I take all the responsibility of the thoughts about terrorizing me after attempting to understand anything found in this repository.*
